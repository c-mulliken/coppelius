i am building a Belli for courses at brown. the basic idea is this: users will add courses they've taken and, in turn, compare the quality of them. the mvp should be as simple as possible. it should have a full database of courses offered since 2019, scraped from the Courses @ Brown website as illustrated in API_example.py. users should be able to easily add courses they've taken, and then be prompted to compare the courses (i.e. what CSCI 0300 or ENGL 0150 better?). this is very crude, i know, but i just want to get it working. i'd like to start by building the API.
